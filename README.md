# incognitosdk-python
Python API for Incognito SDK

To use this library in your applications, just run the command below in the root directory:

```
pip3 install .
```

As of now, the library is incomplete. As time goes by, we'll try to evolve it. The current version supports:

- Some subscription methods (require a full node with websocket support)
- Two main pDEX methods
